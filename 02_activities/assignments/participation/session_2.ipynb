    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Year: 2016\n",
    "Study: Published research claimed a molecular compound could treat cancer.\n",
    "Evidence: Used cell staining images to support findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Issue Discovered\n",
    "\n",
    "Investigator: Dr. Elisabeth Bik, microbiologist.\n",
    "Problem: Found \"problematic duplications\" in the images, suggesting manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrity: Accurate images are crucial for research credibility.\n",
    "Vigilance: Researchers must check for and report inconsistencies.\n",
    "Consequences: Manipulation can lead to retractions and loss of trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise: Look at original images to spot duplications or manipulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensuring honest and accurate use of images in research is essential for trust and progress in science."

    "\n",
    "## What is Reproducibility?\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: The ability for others to check your work because data, code, and methods are available.\n",
    "Purpose: Enables others to repeat your steps to generate the same results or images from the data.\n",
    "Importance\n",
    "Ethical: Transparency and accountability in research.\n",
    "Practical:\n",
    "Easier to make edits.\n",
    "Facilitates new work based on previous efforts.\n",
    "Aids in version control.\n",
    "Ethical Guidelines\n",
    "Source: American Statistical Association\n",
    "Principle: Good practice is based on transparent assumptions, reproducible results, and valid interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Aspects\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: Easier to modify plots/images later.\n",
    "Efficiency: Reuse and build on past work.\n",
    "Version Control: Track and see changes clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "Not a Guarantee of Correctness: Reproducibility doesn't mean the result is correct, but it's essential for scientific progress.\n",
    "Transparency: Critical for the evolution of scientific knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How to Make Data Visualizations Reproducible\n",
    "Work Programmatically\n",
    "\n",
    "Use code (e.g., ggplot in R, matplotlib in Python) to create figures.\n",
    "Avoid manual programs like Adobe Illustrator.\n",
    "Work in Plain Text\n",
    "\n",
    "Write code in simple, plain-text formats (e.g., .py, .R, .txt).\n",
    "Avoid word processors like Microsoft Word.\n",
    "Comment Your Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain what choices were made and why.\n",
    "Makes the code easier to understand, maintain, and update."

    "Insights: Trends in gun violence, hotspots of activity, and possibly correlations with other factors (e.g., socioeconomic status).\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective and Neutral?\n",
    "Objective: If it presents raw data accurately without manipulation or selective presentation, it is objective.\n",

    "\n",
    "Objective and Neutral?\n",
    "Objective: It is objective if it uses comprehensive data from reliable sources without selective reporting.\n",

    "Both visualizations provide valuable insights but need careful analysis to ensure they are objective and neutral. By presenting data accurately and designing visuals thoughtfully, we can ensure the integrity and usefulness of the information provided."
