# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      GOOD: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/shreya.arya/viz/RecommendedDailyWaterIntakeB2VB/Water

      Why is it Good?

      Clarity and Simplicity:

      The visualization uses clean, simple lines and shapes, making it easy to understand at a glance.
      Appropriate use of colors to distinguish different data points without overwhelming the viewer.
      Legends and labels are clearly placed and informative.
      
      Accuracy:

      The data is accurately represented without distortion. 

      Context and Relevance:

      Provides sufficient context for the data, including sources, time frame, and any necessary explanations or annotations.

      Relevant to the audience, providing insights that are meaningful and useful.

      BAD: https://i.imgur.com/tVE9XtI.jpeg

      Why is it bad: 

      1. It difficult to follow the main points. The visualization uses too many lines, leading to visual clutter.
      Poor use of space, with elements crammed together or overlapping, making it hard to read labels and data points.

      2. Lack of Context:

      Insufficient context is provided, with no clear explanation of the data sources, time frame, or significance of the data.
      Missing legends, labels, or annotations, leaving the viewer confused about what is being shown.

      3. Using the wrong graphs/charts for their particular purpose and as a result - creating misleading graph. Trying to incorporate too much information in one graph.

      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Simplify the Design: Reduce the number of elements and use a more straightforward design to make the visualization clearer.

      Accurate Representation: Ensure that all scales and axes are properly labeled and proportional to accurately reflect the data.

      Add Context: Provide clear legends, labels, and annotations to explain what the data represents and why it is important.

      Enhance Accessibility: Use color schemes that are accessible to colorblind individuals and ensure that text is readable.
      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
